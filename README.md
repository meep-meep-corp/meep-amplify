## Description
MeepMeep is the new sustainable urban mobility app that connects you with every transport in your city. Combine public and private transport like trains, buses, scooters & more in one single app.

#1 Transparent Mobility Footprint: As we know your trips, weâ€™ll reward you depending on your carbon emissions. You can only go up in the MeepMeep-Ranking with the more number of green vehicules you take. From time to time you and your friends might get challenges to compete between you, with other users or even other cities. If you win you will get discounts for the transport you use in your daily basis.

#2 Ticketing for Connected Mobility: Our infrastructure allows us to communicate with our partners in a decentralized and trustful manner using a blockchain technology named AWS Hyperledger Fabric. Many existing business networks rely on central authorities, which can be inefficient, expensive, and requires time-consuming auditing. With our solution our multiple providers can independently verify transaction history in a single, up to date, accurate view of data. Business logic among these multiple organisations is simplified through automation. 

#3 Ease the Payment for Mobility: At the end of the month our riders will get one single bill for all the trips in that particular month.
